# Final Project

1. <b>Topic: I want to design a map using geodata of major sports arenas.</b><br>
Sports have always been a huge passion of mine so it would be interesting to explore it for a final project.<br>
Data can be found here: https://hifld-geoplatform.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/major-sport-venues

2. <b>Question: I want to find out whether traveling affects performance.</b><br>
Using statistics from the games (currently looking at NBA), I want to see if the effects of traveling can be seen in the numbers:<br>
For example, whether going from one away arena to another to yet another will see an average decrease of points scored.<br>
There are numerous contributing factors, but I want to focus on geographical ones, such as distance traveled and time zone difference.<br> 
Data I may use: https://www.basketball-reference.com/leagues/NBA_2021.html

3. <b>Significance: I want to help the user better understand the reasoning behind home advantage.</b><br>
Due to the current pandemic, the majority of NBA teams are not allowing spectators into the stadiums.<br>
Cheering and booing are long believed to be a core reason of home advantage, so this policy eliminates both from the equation completely.<br>
I believe this is a good opportunity to narrow down the factors to more geographical ones.<br>
On the other hand, even if the numbers are inconclusive, it would boost the notion that cheering and booing are actually effective!
